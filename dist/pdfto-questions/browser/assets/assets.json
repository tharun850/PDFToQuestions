        "explain": "Two important remains of the oldest times are fortifications of the old Rajagriha town, in Bihar and the fortified capital of Sisupalgarh, perhaps the ancient Kalinganagar, near Bhubaneswar.   The Rajagriha fortification wall is made in the roughest possible manner, unhewn stones being piled one on top of the other. This belongs to the 6th-5th century, B.C.   However at Sisupalgarh in the 2nd-1st century B.C. stone masons were at work using large blocks of stones to make a very well-made fort entrance that could be closed with huge doors turning on hinges.  Stone masonry and stone carving were imported in Ashoka’s times from Persia.   There is abundant evidence of stone masons marks similar to those at Persepolis. However, wood was still the dominant material and in architectural remains of Ashokan times, the gradual transition from wood to stone is apparent.   At Pataliputra, remains have been found of a great timber wall that once surrounded the imperial capital, a fact clearly mentioned by Megasthanes who states that everything in his day was built of timber in India.  However, there is one important exception to this and that is the rock-cut architecture of India. Early Indian cave temples and monasteries are masterpieces of “organising space” with beauty and utility in view.  A typical example of early cave architecture is the most datable cave of all, the so-called Lomas Rishi cave in the Barabar Hills of Bihar.   An inscription proves that this was excavated for the Ajivika sect in the time of Ashoka himself. The cave carved out of the living rock, measures 55’x22’x20′. The entrance is a representation in stone of a hut entrance, with the end of the roof constructed of bent timber supported by cross beams, the ends of which are shown protruding.   A carved frieze of elephants is a stone imitation of similar work in wood along with a stone imitation of trellis work made of small stick of bamboo. This is an excellent example       showing the development from earlier shapes in timber translated into stone. The period is the 3rd century B.C.  "

        },
        "answer": "D",
        "explain": " Badami, formerly known as Vatapi  It is a town and headquarters of a taluk by the same name, in the Bagalkot district of Karnataka, India.   It was the regal capital of the Badami Chalukyas from 540 to 757 AD.   It is famous for its rock cut structural temples.   It is located in a ravine at the foot of a rugged, red sandstone outcrop that surrounds Agastya lake. Badami has been selected as one of the heritage cities for HRIDAY - Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana scheme of Government of India.   Badami Chalukyas was founded in 540 AD by Pulakeshin I (535-566 AD), an early ruler of the Chalukyas is generally regarded as the founder of the Early Chalukya line.   An inscription record of this king engraved on a boulder in Badami records the fortification of the hill above \"Vatapi\" in 544.   Pulakeshin\u0027s choice of this location for his capital was no doubt dedicated by strategic considerations since Badami is protected on three sides by rugged sandstone cliffs.   His sons Kirtivarman I (567-598 AD) and his brother Mangalesha (598-610 AD) constructed the cave temples. Kirtivarman I strengthened Vatapi and had three sons Pulakeshin II, Vishnuvardhana and Buddhavarasa, who at his death were minors, thus making them       ineligible to rule, so Kirtivarman I\u0027s brother Mangalesha took the throne and tried to establish rule, only to be killed by Pulakeshin II who ruled between 610 A.D to 642 A.D.  Vatapi was the capital of the Early Chalukyas, who ruled much of Karnataka, Maharashtra, parts of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh between the 6th and 8th centuries.   The greatest among them was Pulakeshin II (610-642 AD) who defeated many kings including the Pallavas of Kanchipuram.   The rock-cut Badami Cave Temples were sculpted mostly between the 6th and 8th centuries. Badami has eighteen inscriptions, among them some inscriptions are important.  The first Sanskrit inscription in old Kannada script, on a hillock dates back to 543 CE, from the period of Pulakeshin I (Vallabheswara), the second is the 578 CE cave inscription of Mangalesha in Kannada language and script and the third is the Kappe Arabhatta records, the earliest available Kannada poetry in tripadi (three line) metre.   One inscription near the Bhuthanatha temple also has inscriptions dating back to the 12th century in Jain rock-cut temple dedicated to the Tirtankara Adinatha.  Aihole , also referred to as Aivalli, Ahivolal or Aryapura  It is a historic site of ancient and medieval era Buddhist, Hindu and Jain monuments in north Karnataka (India) dated from the fourth century through the twelfth century CE.  Located around an eponymous small village surrounded by farmlands and sandstone hills, Aihole is a major archaeological site featuring over one hundred and twenty stone and cave temples from this period, spread along the Malaprabha river valley, in Bagalakote district.  Aihole is 22 miles (35 km) from Badami and about 6 miles (9.7 km) from Pattadakal, both of which are major centers of historically important Chalukya monuments.   Aihole, along with nearby Badami (Vatapi), emerged by the 6th century as the cradle of experimentation with temple architecture, stone artwork, and construction techniques.  This resulted in 16 types of free-standing temples and 4 types of rock-cut shrines. The experimentation in architecture and arts that began in Aihole yielded the group of monuments at Pattadakal, a UNESCO world heritage site.   Over one hundred Aihole temples are Hindu, a few are Jain and one is Buddhist. These were built and coexisted in close proximity. The site is spread over about 5 square kilometres (1.9 sq mi).   The Hindu temples are dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu, Durga, Surya and other Hindu deities.  The Jain Basadi temples are dedicated to Mahavira, Parshvanatha, Neminatha and other Jain Tirthankaras. The Buddhist monument is a monastery.  Both Hindu and Jain monuments include monasteries, as well as social utilities such as stepwell water tanks with artistic carvings near major temples   "

        "explain": "approximately between 320- 550 CE. The Gupta dynasty period is regarded as the Golden Age of India. The Gupta Empire was not only popular for the over- all development and prosperity of the Empire, but was also popular for its paintings.        Ajanta Cave no 16 – Dying princess    Gupta - Art and Architecture Art and Architecture bloomed during the Gupta dynasty. As a matter of fact, one of the similarities between the Mauryan Empire and Gupta Empire was that the rulers of both these dynasties were royal patrons of different kinds of art. During the Gupta Empire, art reached its peak and hence this period was also referred to as the ‘Golden Age.’  This artistic wealth was responsible for bringing about a cultural resurgence. The art of this era flourished more than it flourished in any era or dynasty. The art of this period was a beautiful blend of the earlier art as well as of a new style and technique which subsequently developed under this Empire. The art and architecture of the Gupta Dynasty can be classified as follows:  Buddhist Architecture of Gupta Period –  • Out of all the Buddhist creations so made during this period, the rock-cut monastery in the Ajanta Caves is well known. This monastery consisted of various Chaitya halls along with numerous residential Viharas. Its portico as well as its interiors has graceful sculptures on them. Different kind of splendid murals filled up the interiors of this structure.  • Bronze and hard black stone images have also been excavated at Nalanda and such other places which indicate their deep focus towards ornamentation as well as fabrication. In addition to this, there were two Buddhist stupas which stand as prototypes of stupa architecture from this period. The ‘Mirpur Khas Stupa’ built in the 4th century AD consisted of a variety of arches.  • The curves of this particular stupa also clear one more point that the Indians were well acquainted with the art of arch-making. The artifacts of the ‘Dhameka Stupa’ are truly an expression of the Gupta architecture. Apart from this, there were also several Buddhist, Jains as well as Brahmin sects which was another important aspect of the Gupta Empire.  • Ajanta, Ellora and the Bagh cave paintings indicate a Buddhist philosophy which gained immense popularity during the reign of this empire. Interestingly, out of so many cave paintings which were so created during this period, each is drastically different from one another though all of them maintain the same level of elegance.   Temple architecture of the Gupta Period –  • The Gupta Dynasty were truly the torchbearers as far as the history of temple architecture are concerned. It was the first time that the Guptas made use of permanent materials like       bricks and stones instead of making use of the usual fragile materials like bamboo, wood etc.  • Cave temples were replaced by structural temples for the purpose of idol worship. The different kinds of temple structures denote the artistic brilliance of the Gupta Empire. These temple designs became the benchmark for the subsequent creations so made by the latter Dynasties like for instance the temple of Dasavatar at Deogarh is a sheer delight with brilliant carvings and panel constructions.  • The Siva temple at Nachana, the Parvati temple at Ajaya Garh in Uttar Pradesh, the Vishnu temple in the Central Province, the Ekkalinga Shiva temple at Satana are some of the other examples of temple architectures belonging to this Dynasty. • Sculpture of Gupta Period –  • Sculpture was taken to an altogether different level by the Gupta Empire. Originally, the art of sculpting started in Mathura but subsequently it was at Sarnath that this art was made nothing less than perfect. It was the same place where Gautam Buddha turned the wheel of law. Hence, Mathura and Sarnath became the prime centers where sculpting was practiced.  • The Shiv-Parvati relics in Kosam, the Ramayana panel in Deogarh and also at Sarnath were some of the main sculptures so erected during the Gupta period. The sculpture of this period truly depicts the artistic perfection of the Gupta period artists. Additionally, the Gandhara School of art and sculpture as well as the Mathura school of art also contributed heavily to the art of sculpting.   Paintings of the Gupta Period –  • Paintings also occupied a rather important place in the varied forms of art which flourished during the Gupta period reign. However, one important thing which can be deduced from the paintings of this era was that the paintings had acquired a secular character during the reign of the Gupta Dynasty.  • One of the peculiar features of carrying in this art was that contrary to the other forms of art, this art was practiced by both namely the rich as well as the poor people. Hence it had some sort of a universal appeal to it. Common masses, however, used scrolls of linen to paint. The cave paintings at Ajanta, Badami as well as Bagh truly represent a clear picture of the Gupta period’s art of painting.  • Jataka tales as well as the life of Gautam Buddha were the two most common subjects when it came to painting. As a matter of fact, the Bodhisattva – Padmapani was considered as one of the best paintings to have been produced during this period.  • This painting depicts Bodhisattva standing in a ‘trivanga’ style with his face depicting a youth with jeweled crown on his head and holding a white lotus in his right hand. His face displays the emotions of sympathy and sorrow for the fellow beings while he is looking below from the heaven.  • Whether it was through the paintings or through sculpture or by way of temple architecture, the varied forms of art have consistently displayed an artist’s perfection as well as finesse thereby creating certain benchmarks for these arts.  • Apart from this, the different Kings of this empire were also royal patrons of art due to which the artisans received a lot of patronage to pursue as well as perfect the different kinds of arts. It is because of all these reasons that this period is often also referred to as the ‘Golden Period’ in the history of the Gupta Empire.        "

        },
        "answer": "D",
        "explain": " Dhrupad is a genre in Hindustani classical music. It is the oldest of the three major vocal styles associated with Hindustani classical music and the most closely related to the South Indian Carnatic tradition. It is a Sanskrit name, derived from the words dhruva (immovable, permanent) and pad (verse), a combination that means \"pillar\". The roots of Dhrupad are ancient, and it is discussed in the Hindu Sanskrit text Natyashastra (~200 BCE – 200 CE). It is also described in other ancient and medieval Sanskrit texts, such as chapter 33 of Book 10 in the Bhagavata Purana (~800–1000 CE), where the theories of music and devotional songs for Krishna are summarized.  The term denotes both the verse form of the poetry and the style in which it is sung. It is spiritual, heroic, thoughtful, virtuous, embedding moral wisdom or solemn form of song-music combination. Thematic matter ranges from the religious and spiritual (mostly in praise of Hindu deities) to royal panegyrics, musicology and romance.  A Dhrupad has at least four stanzas, called Sthayi (or Asthayi), Antara, Sancari and Abhoga.  • The Sthayi part is a melody that uses the middle octave\u0027s first tetrachord and the lower octave notes.  • The Antara part uses the middle octave\u0027s second tetrachord and the higher octave notes.  • The Samcari part is the development phase, which holistically builds using parts of Sthayi and Antara already played, and it uses melodic material built with all the three octave notes.        • The Abhoga is the concluding section, that brings the listener back to the familiar starting point of Sthayi, albeit with rhythmic variations, with diminished notes like a gentle goodbye, that are ideally mathematical fractions such as dagun (half), tigun (third) or caugun (fourth).  • Sometimes a fifth stanza called Bhoga is included.  • Though usually related to philosophical or Bhakti (emotional devotion to a god or goddess) themes, some Dhrupads were composed to praise kings    "

        "explain": "Chaitya is place of worship and Viharas are residence hall  The Karla Caves, Karli Caves, Karle Caves or Karla Cells, are a complex of ancient Buddhist Indian rock-cut caves at Karli near Lonavala, Maharashtra. The shrines were developed over the period – from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD. The oldest of the cave shrines is believed to date back to 160 BC, having arisen near a major ancient trade route, running eastward from the Arabian Sea into the Deccan.  The group at Karla is one of the older and smaller of the many rock-cut Buddhist sites in Maharashtra, but is one of the best-known because of the famous \"Grand Chaitya\" (Cave 8), which is \"the largest and most completely preserved\" chaitya hall of the period, as well as containing unusual quantities of fine sculpture, much of it on a large scale.  Many traders and Satavahana rulers made grants for construction of these caves. Karli\u0027s location in Maharashtra places it in a region that marks the division between North India and South India. Buddhists, having become identified with commerce and manufacturing through their early association with traders, tended to locate their monastic establishments in natural geographic formations close to major trade routes so as to provide lodging houses for travelling traders. Today, the cave complex is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India.    "

        "answer": "A",
        "explain": "Lomus Rishi was patronized by Asoka for Ajivika sect       Ellora caves – Cave 1 to 12 Buddhism, 13 to 29 – Brahmanical , 30 to 34 - Jaina  The Lomas Rishi Cave, also called the Grotto of Lomas Rishi, is one of the man-made Barabar Caves in the Barabar and Nagarjuni hills of Jehanabad district in the Indian state of Bihar. This rock-cut cave was carved out as a sanctuary. It was built during the Ashokan period of the Maurya Empire in the 3rd century BC, as part of the sacred architecture of the Ajivikas, an ancient religious and philosophical group of India that competed with Jainism and became extinct over time. Ājīvikas were atheists and rejected the authority of the Vedas as well as Buddhist ideas. They were ascetic communities and meditated in caves such as Lomas Rishi. The hut-style facade at the entrance to the cave is the earliest survival of the ogee shaped \"chaitya arch\" or chandrashala that was to be an important feature of Indian rock-cut architecture and sculptural decoration for centuries. The form was clearly a reproduction in stone of buildings in wood and other vegetable materials. According to Pia Brancaccio, the Lomas Rishi cave, along with nearby Sudama cave, is considered by many scholars to be \"the prototype for the Buddhist caves of the western Deccan, particularly the chaitya hall type structure built between 2nd century BCE and 2nd century CE. First is a large hall, entered at the side and rectangular in shape measuring 9.86x5.18m, which functioned as an assembly hall. Further inside is a second hall, smaller in size, which is a semi-hemispherical room, 5m in diameter, with a roof in the form of a dome, and which is accessed from the rectangular room by a narrow rectangular passage. The interior surfaces of the chambers are very finely finished  The Barabar Hill Caves are the oldest surviving rock-cut caves in India, mostly dating from the Maurya Empire (322–185 BCE), some with Ashokan inscriptions, located in the Makhdumpur region of Jehanabad district, Bihar, India, 24 km (15 mi) north of Gaya. These caves are situated in the twin hills of Barabar (four caves) and Nagarjuni (three caves); caves of the 1.6 km (0.99 mi)-distant Nagarjuni Hill are sometimes singled out as the Nagarjuni Caves. These rock-cut chambers date back to the 3rd century BCE, Maurya period, of Ashoka (reigned 273–232 BCE) and his grandson, Dasharatha Maurya. The caves were used by ascetics from the Ajivika sect, founded by Makkhali Gosala, a contemporary of Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, and of Mahavira, the last and 24th Tirthankara of Jainism. Also present at the site are several rock-cut Buddhist and Hindu sculptures and inscriptions from later periods. Most caves at Barabar consist of two chambers, carved entirely out of granite, with a highly polished internal surface and exciting echo effect. The caves were featured – located in a fictitious Marabar – in the book A Passage to India by English author E. M. Forster. These were also shown in the book The Mahabharata Secret by Indian author Christopher C. Doyle.  Ellora, located in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra, India, is one of the largest rock-cut monastery-temple cave complexes in the world, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, featuring Buddhist, Hindu and Jain monuments, and artwork, dating from the 600-1000 CE period. Cave 16, in particular, features the largest single monolithic rock excavation in the world, the Kailasha temple, a chariot shaped monument dedicated to Shiva. The Kailasha temple excavation also features the gods, goddesses, and mythologies found in Vaishnavism, Shaktism as well as relief panels summarizing the two major Hindu Epics. There are over 100 caves at the site, all excavated from the basalt cliffs in the Charanandri Hills, 34 of which are open to public. They were built in proximity to one another and illustrate the religious harmony that existed in ancient India. All of the Ellora monuments were built during Hindu dynasties such as the Rashtrakuta dynasty, which       constructed part of the Hindu \u0026 Buddhist caves, and the Yadava dynasty, which constructed a number of the Jain caves. Funding for the construction of the monuments was provided by royals, traders and the wealthy of the region. Although the caves served as monasteries, temples and a rest stop for pilgrims, its location on an ancient South Asian trade route also made it an important commercial centre in the Deccan region. Today, the Ellora Caves, along with the nearby Ajanta Caves, are a major tourist attraction in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra and a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India    "

It is located between the temple entrance and the Garba griha that is to say, the heart of the sanctuary. It is typical of the Nagara architecture temples of northern India  In North india ,The tallest tower is called shikhara , subsdiary towers are called urushringas , and raised platform is called Jagati  Elaborate gateway-towers of South Indian temples, called \"gopurams\"   Shikharas form an element in the many styles of Hindu temple architecture, of which the three most common are -   Nagara style prevalent in northern India. The shikhara is a high curved shape, and so called. In the north-east, the local term deul or deula is more often used, both for towers and often the whole temple. Within Nagara style - In Odisha a Rekha Deula is the sanctum and the tower over it; gandi is also a term for the upper tower only, equating to shikhara. In Odisha the curve is very slight until the top, and the amalaka rather large, typically supported by four lion sculptures facing out. Of the many temples in Bhubaneswar, only the Rajarani Temple has significant spirelets.  Vesara style, a synthesis of Nagara and Dravida, seen mostly in Karnataka and most commonly in Hoysala and later Chalukya temples. In the vesara style, the tower moves towards a lower conical shape, with highly ornate carving.  Dravidian style prevalent in southern India : The equivalent of the shikhara is the vimana. The superstructure above the sanctum is typically more like a four-sided pyramid in overall shape, consisting of progressively smaller storeys of pavilions (talas), with a profile that is normally straight rather than curved. The Dravidian superstructure is generally highly ornate. In every style of shikhara/vimana, the structure culminates with a \"kalasha\", or urn for offerings, or water-pot, at its peak.          "

It is a festival of the Hindu community in the Saloor Dungra village of the Painkhanda Valley in the Chamoli district in Uttarakhand, India. The festival and the eponymous art form are conducted as an offering to the village deity, Bhumiyal Devta, in the courtyard of the village temple. The Ramman is unique to the village and is neither replicated nor performed anywhere else in the Himalayan region.   Ramman combines the sacred and the social, the ritualistic with revelry and expresses the history, faith, lifestyle, fears and hopes of the Saloor Dungra villagers through a mesh of oral, literary, visual, kinetic and traditional craft forms. It is an annual affair that children learn by watching. The various skills it involves in terms of dance, singing and drumming are passed down across hereditary communities orally. The onslaught of globalization and technology and lack of financial or artistic compensation have adversely impacted the ritual and traditional performances of the Ramman. Being peripheral to mainstream art forms, the awareness of the Ramman beyond its immediate borders is small and it stands the risk of becoming extinct in time. In 2009, UNESCO inscribed Ramman on its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.          "

        "explain": " Konark Sun Temple is a 13th-century CE sun temple at Konark about 35 kilometres (22 mi) northeast from Puri on the coastline of Odisha, India. The temple is attributed to king Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty about 1250 CE. Dedicated to the Hindu god Surya, what remains of the temple complex has the appearance of a 100-foot (30 m) high chariot with immense wheels and horses, all carved from stone. Once over 200 feet (61 m) high, much of the temple is now in ruins, in particular the large shikara tower over the sanctuary; at one time this rose much higher than the mandapa that remains. The structures and elements that have survived are famed for their intricate artwork, iconography, and themes, including erotic kama and mithuna scenes. Also called the Surya Devalaya, it is a classic illustration of the Odisha style of Hindu temple architecture. The cause of the destruction of the Konark temple is unclear and remains a source of controversy. Theories range from natural damage to deliberate destruction of the temple in the course of being sacked several times by Muslim armies between the 15th and 17th centuries. This temple was called the \"Black Pagoda\" in European sailor accounts as early as 1676 because its great tower appeared black. Similarly, the Jagannath Temple in Puri was called the \"White Pagoda\". Both temples served as important landmarks for sailors in the Bay of Bengal. The temple that exists today was partially restored by the conservation efforts of British India-era archaeological teams. Declared a UNESCO world heritage site in 1984,it remains a major pilgrimage site for Hindus, who gather here every year for the Chandrabhaga Mela around the month of February. http://www.thehindu.comworld-class-tourist-facilities-at-konark-temple-in-odisha/article23396122.ece        "

While, in the Mauryan pillars, the inverted lotus appears at the top of the shaft,  • Most of the Persian pillars have a fluted surface while the Mauryan pillars are smooth,  • The Maurya type abacus and independent animals carved in the round crowing the pillars are absent in the Persian context.  • The Achaemenian shaft are built of separate segments of stone aggregated one above the other which is the work of mason. The shaft of the Mauryan pillar is monolithic which pertains to the character of the work of a skilled wood-carver or carpenter,  • The Achaemenid pillars were generally part of some larger architectural scheme, composed of much too many component parts looking complex and complicated.

The Buland Darwaza was built in honor of his successful campaign in Gujarat. It is 54 metres (177 ft) high.  It carries two inscriptions in the archway, one of which reads: \"Isa, Son of Mariam said: The world is a bridge, pass over it, but build no houses on it. He who hopes for an hour may hope for eternity. The world endures but an hour. Spend it in prayer, for the rest is unseen\".  After occupying Agra in 1803, the East India Company established an administrative centre here and it remained so until 1850.

Except for a few exceptions, much of the artwork is defaced and damaged.  The main temple\u0027s orientation as well as the relative location of other temples are placed in a mandala pattern.  The carvings narrate Hindu mythologies, with the large monolithic 5.45 metres (17.9 ft) Trimurti Sadashiva (three-faced Shiva), Nataraja (Lord of dance) and Yogishvara (Lord of Yoga) being the most celebrated.  These date to between the 5th and 9th centuries, and scholars attribute them to various Hindu dynasties. They are most commonly placed between the 5th and 7th centuries. Many scholars consider them to have been completed by about 550 CE.  They were named Elefante – which morphed to Elephanta – by the colonial Portuguese who found elephant statues on the caves. They established a base on the island.         The main cave (Cave 1, or the Great Cave) was a Hindu place of worship until the Portuguese arrived, whereupon the island ceased to be an active place of worship.  The earliest attempts to prevent further damage to the caves were started by British India officials in 1909. The monuments were restored in the 1970s   It is currently maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)  The island has two groups of rock-cut caves, hewn from solid basalt rock.

They contain Buddhist sculptures and relief carvings, paintings and inscriptions, dating from the 1st century BCE to the 10th century CE. Kanheri comes from the Sanskrit Krishnagiri, which means black mountain. A congregation hall with huge stone pillars contains a stupa (a Buddhist shrine). Rock-cut channels above the caves fed rainwater into cisterns, which provided the complex with water. Once the caves were converted to permanent monasteries, their walls were carved with intricate reliefs of Buddha and the Bodhisattvas. Kanheri had become an important Buddhist settlement on the Konkan coast by the 3rd century CE. Most of the caves were Buddhist viharas, meant for living, studying, and meditating. The larger caves, which functioned as chaityas, or halls for congregational worship, are lined with intricately carved Buddhist sculptures, reliefs, pillars and rock-cut stupas. Avalokiteshwara is the most distinctive figure. The large number of viharas demonstrates there was a well organized establishment of Buddhist monks. This establishment was also connected with many trade centers, such as the ports of Sopara, Kalyan, Nasik, Paithan and Ujjain. Kanheri was a University center by the time the area was under the rule of the Maurayan and Kushan empires. In the late 10th century, the Buddhist teacher Atisha (980–1054) came to the Krishnagiri Vihara to study Buddhist meditation under Rahulagupta   "

Its three distinct styles hail from the regions of Seraikella, Purulia and Mayurbhanj, the first two using masks. Chhau dance is intimately connected to regional festivals, notably the spring festival Chaitra Parva. Its origin is traceable to indigenous forms of dance and martial practices. Its vocabulary of movement includes mock combat techniques, stylized gaits of birds and animals and movements modelled on the chores of village housewives. Chhau is taught to male dancers from families of traditional artists or from local communities. The dance is performed at night in an open space to traditional and folk melodies, played on the reed pipes \u0027\u0027mohuri\u0027\u0027 and \u0027\u0027shehnai.\u0027\u0027 The reverberating drumbeats of a variety of drums dominate the accompanying music ensemble.   Chhau is an integral part of the culture of these communities. It binds together people from different social strata and ethnic background with diverse social practices, beliefs, professions and languages. However, increasing industrialization, economic pressures and new media are leading to a decrease in collective participation with communities becoming disconnected from their roots.

        "answer": "C",
        "explain": "Mohiniyattam literally interpreted as the dance of ‘Mohini’, the celestial enchantress of the Hindu mythology, is the classical solo dance form of Kerala. According to a Puranic story, Lord Vishnu took on the guise of a ‘Mohini’ to seduce the Asuras, both in connection with churning of the ocean and episode of the slaying of Bhasmasura. The delicate body movements and subtle facial expressions are more feminine in nature and therefore are ideally suited for performance by women. References of Mohiniyattam can be found in the texts Vyavaharamala written in 1709 by Mazhamagalam Narayanan Namputiri and in Ghoshayatra, written later by great poet Kunjan Nambiar. The dancers were called by different names during different periods of time. They were called as TaiNangai or Nangachi (one with beautiful hand), Dasi (servant), Tevitichi or Deva-Adi-Achi (the one who served at the feet of the Lord), Koothachi (who performed koothu or dance).  Their dances were known as ‘Nangai Natakam, Dasiyattam, Tevitichiyattam, etc. The Nangiars, who are the women folk of Nambiar community, still follow a strict code of dance, performed in a small performing space, within the temple precincts, as practised in the olden times. This dance form of Kerala was structured into the present day classical format by the Travancore Kings, Maharaja KartikaTirunal and his successor Maharaja Swati Tirunal (18th -19th century C.E.).Swati Tirunal,who ascended the throne when he was barely 16 years old in 1829, promoted all fine arts, particularly music and dancing. During his reign there was a flow of artists and scholars from all parts of India to Travancore, the region of the Kerala Maharajas. It was during that time, Swati along with his court musicians (Kilimanoor Vidwan Koyil Tampuran and IrayimmanTampi) was engaged in developing       Mohiniyattam. Mohiniyattam is characterized by graceful, swaying body movements with no abrupt jerks or sudden leaps. It belongs to the lasya style which is feminine, tender and graceful. The movements are emphasized by the glides and the up and down movement on toes, like the waves of the sea and the swaying of the coconut, palm trees and the paddy fields. The gestures and facial expressions are closer to the natural (gramya) and the realistic (lokadharmi) than to the dramatic or rigidly conventional (natyadharmi). The traditional repertoire includes Chollukettu, Jatiswaram, Padavarnam, Padam,Tillana and Slokam.    "

        "explain": "Bharatnatyam Dance is considered to be over 2000 years old. Several texts beginning with Bharata Muni\u0027s Natya Shastra (200 B.C.E. to 200 C.E.) provide information on this dance form. The Abhinaya Darpana by Nandikesvara is one of the main sources of textual material, for the study of the technique and grammar of body movement in Bharatnatyam Dance. There is also a great deal of visual evidence of this dance form in paintings and stone and metal sculptures of ancient times. On the gopurams of the Chidambaram temple, one can see a series of Bharatnatyam poses, frozen in stone as it were, by the sculptor. In many other temples, the charis and karanas of the dance are represented in sculpture and one can make a study of the dance form. Bharatnatyam dance is known to be ekaharya, where one dancer takes on many roles in a single performance. In the early 19th century, the famous Tanjore Quartette, under the patronage of Raja Serfoji are said to have been responsible for the repertoire of Bharatnatyam dance as we see it today.The style was kept alive by the devadasis, who were young girls \u0027gifted\u0027 by their parents to the temples and who were married to the gods. The devadasis performed music and dance as offerings to the deities, in the temple courtyards. Some of the renowned performers and gurus of the early part of the century belong to the devadasi families, a well-known name is Bala Saraswati.  At first there is an invocation song. The first dance item is the alarippu, literally meaning - to adorn with flowers. It is an abstract piece combining pure dance with the recitation of sound syllables. The next item, the jatiswaram is a short pure dance piece performed to the accompaniment of musical notes of any raga of Carnatic music. Jatiswaram has no sahitya or words, but is composed of adavus which are pure dance sequences - nritta. They form the basis of training in Bharatnatyam dance.  As a solo dance, Bharatnatyam leans heavily on the abhinaya or mime aspect of dance - the nritya, where the dancer expresses the sahitya through movement and mime. Shabdam follows the jatiswaram in a Bharatnatyam dance performance. The accompanying song is generally in adoration of the Supreme Being.  After the shabdam, the dancer performs the varnam. The varnam which is the most important composition of the Bharatnatyam repertoire, encompasses both nritta and nritya and epitomises the essence of this classical dance form. The dancer here performs complicated well graded rhythmic patterns in two speeds showing the control over rhythm, and then goes on to depict in a       variety of ways, through abhinaya the lines of the sahitya. This portrays the dancer\u0027s excellence in abhinaya and also reflects the endless creativity of the choreographer.   The varnam is by far one of the most beautiful compositions in Indian dance. After the strenuous varnam, the dancer performs a number of abhinaya items expressing a variety of moods. The bhavaor rasa is woven into the sahitya and then expressed by the dancer. The common pieces are keertanam, kritis, padamsand javalis. In the keertanam, the text is important whereas kriti is a composition in which the musical aspect is highlighted. Both are usually devotional in character and represent episodes from the lives of Rama, Siva, Vishnu, etc. Padams and javalis, are on the theme of love, often divine.  A Bharatnatyam performance ends with a tillana which has its origin in the tarana of Hindustani music. It is a vibrant dance performed to the accompaniment of musical syllables with a few lines of sahitya. The finale of the piece is a series of well designed rhythmic lines reaching a climax. The performance ends with a mangalam invoking the blessings of the Gods. The accompanying orchestra consists of a vocalist, a mridangam player, violinist or veena player, a flautist and a cymbal player. The person who conducts the dance recitation is the Nattuvanar.     "

        "answer": "B",
        "explain": " Kuchipudi is one of the classical styles of Indian dance. Around the third and fourth decade of this century it emerged out of a long rich tradition of dance-drama of the same name. Kuchipudi is the name of a village in the Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh. It is about 35 km. from Vijayawada. Andhra has a very long tradition of dance-drama which was known under the generic name of Yakshagaana. In 17th century Kuchipudi style of Yakshagaana was conceived by Siddhendra Yogi a talented Vaishnava poet and visionary who had the capacity to give concrete shape to some of his visions. He was steeped in the literary Yakshagaana tradition being guided by his guru Teerthanaaraayana Yogi who composed the Krishna-Leelatarangini. a kaavya in Sanskrit. It is said that Siddhendra Yogi had a dream in which Lord Krishna asked him to compose a dance drama based on the myth of the bringing of paarijaata flower for Sathyabhaama, the most beloved queen of Krishna. In compliance with this command Siddhendra Yogi composed the Bhaamaakalaapam which is till now considered the piece-deresistance of the Kuchipudi repertoire.   Siddhendra Yogi initiated young Brahmin boys of Kuchipudi village to practice and perform his compositions particularly Bhaamaakalaapam. The presentation of Bhaamaakalaapam was a stupendous success. Its aesthetic appeal was so great that the then Nawab of Golconda, Abdul Hasan Tanishah issued a copper plate in 1675 A.D. granting the village Kuchipudi as an       Agrahaarama to the families of Brahmins who pursued this art. At that time all the actors were male and the female impersonation was of a superb quality. To have an idea of the high standard of female impersonation one should see Vedaantam Satyanarayana Sharma, a great Kuchipudi dancer, even today doing the role of Satyabhaama. The followers of Siddhendra Yogi wrote several plays and the tradition of Kuchipudi dance-drama continues till today.   It was Lakshminarayan Shastry (1886-1956) who introduced many new elements including solo dancing and training of female dancers in this dance style.  Solo dancing was there earlier, but only as a part of the dance drama at appropriate sequences. \u0027At times, even though the dramatic situation did not demand, solo dancing was being presented to punctuate the presentation and to enhance the appeal. One such number is tarangam inspired by the Krishna-leela tarangini of Teerthanarayana Yogi. To show the dexterity of the dancers in footwork and their control and balance over their bodies, techniques like dancing on the rim of a brass plate and with a pitcher full of water on the head was introduced. Acrobatic dancing became part of the repertoire. By the middle of this century, Kuchipudi fully crystallized as a separate classical solo dance style. Thus there are now two forms of Kuchipudi; the traditional musical dance-drama and the solo dance.   Earlier the invocation was limited to Ganesha Vandana. Now other gods are also invoked. It is followed by nritta, that is, non-narrative and abstract dancing. Usually jatiswaram is performed as the nritta number. Next is presented a narrative number called shabdam. One of the favourite traditional shabdam number is the Dashaavataara. The Shabdam is followed by a natya number called Kalaapam. Many Kuchipudi dancers prefer to perform entry of Satyabhama from the traditional dance-drama Bhaamaakalaapam. The song \"bhamane, satyabhamane, the traditional praveshadaaru (the song that is rendered at the time of the entry of a character) is so tuneful that its appeal is universal and ever fresh. Next in the sequence comes a pure nrityaabhinaya number based on literary-cum musical forms like padam, jaavli, shlokam, etc. In such a number each of the sung words is delineated in space through dance, drishya-kavita (visual poetry). A Kuchipudi recital is usually concluded with tarangam. Excerpts of Krishna-leela-tarangini are sung with this number. In this the dancer usually stands on a brass plate locking the feet in shakatavadanam paada and moves the plate rhythmically with great dexterity.  The music that accompanies the dance is according to the classical school of Carnatic music and is delightfully syncopatic. The accompanying musicians, besides the vocalist are: a mridangam player to provide percussion music, a violin or veena player or both for providing instrumental melodic music, and a cymbal player who usually conducts the orchestra and recites the sollukattus(mnemonic rhythm syllables).

        "answer": "B",
        "explain": "       The Natya Shastra mentions many regional varieties, such as the south-eastern style known as the Odhra Magadha which can be identified as the earliest precursor of present day Odissi. Archaeological evidence of this dance form dating back to the 2nd century B.C. is found in the caves of Udayagiri and Khandagiri near Bhubaneshwar. Later, innumerable examples of the Buddhist sculptures, the tantric images of dancing Yoginis, the Nataraja, and other celestial musicians and dancers of early Shaivite temples bear testimony to a continuing tradition of dance from the 2nd century B.C.E to the 10th century C.E. These influences found synthesis in an unique philosophy - the dharma or faith of Jagannath. With Hinduism taking roots in Odisha by about the 7th century A.D., many imposing temples were erected. The magnificent Sun Temple at Konarak, built in the 13th century, with its Natya mandap or Hall of dance, marks the culmination of the temple building activity in Odisha  For centuries maharis were the chief repositories of this dance. The maharis, who were originally temple dancers came to be employed in royal courts which resulted in the degeneration of the art form. Around this time, a class of boys called gotipuas were trained in the art, they danced in the temples and also for general entertainment.   Odissi is a highly stylised dance and to some extent is based on the classical Natya Shastra and the Abhinaya Darpana. In fact, it has derived a great deal from the Abhinaya Darpana Prakasha by Jadunatha Sinha, theAbhinaya Chandrika by Rajmani Patra, and the Abhinaya Chandrika by Maheshwara Mahapatra.   As in other parts of India, creative literature inspired the Odissi dancer also and provided the themes for dance. This is especially true of the 12th century Gita Govinda by Jayadeva. It is a profound example of thenayaka-nayika bhava and surpasses other poems in its poetic and stylistic content. The devotion of the poet for Krishna permeates through the work.  The techniques of movement are built around the two basic postures of the Chowk and the Tribhanga. The chowk is a position imitating a square - a very masculine stance with the weight of the body equally balanced. The tribhanga is a very feminine stance where the body is deflected at the neck, torso and the knees.             "

The dance in Manipur is associated with rituals and traditional festivals, there are legendary references to the dances of Shiva and Parvati and other gods and goddesses who created the universe.  Lai Haraoba is one of the main festivals still performed in Manipur which has its roots in the pre-Vaishnavite period. Lai Haraoba is the earliest form of dance which forms the basis of all stylised dances in Manipur. Literally meaning - the merrymaking of the gods, it is performed as a ceremonial offering of song and dance. The principal performers are the maibas and maibis (priests and priestesses) who re-enact the theme of the creation of the world. With the arrival of Vaishnavism in the 15th century A.D., new compositions based on episodes from the life of Radha and Krishna were gradually introduced. It was in the reign of King Bhagyachandra that the popular Rasleela dances of Manipur originated. It is said, that this 18th century philosopher king conceived this complete dance form along with its unique costume and music in a dream. Under successive rulers, new leelas, and rhythmic and melodic compositions were introduced. Manipur dance has a large repertoire, however, the most popular forms are the Ras, the Sankirtana and the Thang-Ta. There are five principal Ras dances of which four are linked with specific seasons,       while the fifth can be presented at any time of the year.

        "explain": "       See CCRT notes on Kathakali below. Others already explained  Kathakali, as a dance form popular today, is considered to be of comparatively recent origin. However, it is an art which has evolved from many social and religious theatrical forms which existed in the southern region in ancient times. Chakiarkoothu, Koodiyattam, Krishnattam andRamanattam are few of the ritual performing arts of Kerala which have had a direct influence on Kathakali in its form and technique. Legend has it that the refusal of the Zamorin of Calicut to send his Krishnattam troupe to Travancore, so enraged the Raja of Kottarakkara, that he was inspired to compose the Ramanattam.   In the temple sculptures in Kerala and the frescoes in the Mattancheri temple of approximately the 16th century, dance scenes depicting the square and rectangular basic positions so typical to Kathakali are seen. For body movements and choreographical patterns, Kathakali is also indebted to the early martial arts of Kerala. Kathakali is a blend of dance, music and acting and dramatizes stories, which are mostly adapted from the Indian epics. It is a stylised art form, the four aspects of abhinaya - angika, aharya,vachika, satvika and the nritta, nritya and natya aspects are combined perfectly. The dancer expresses himself through codified hastamudras and facial expressions, closely following the verses(padams) that are sung. Kathakali derives its textual sanction from Balarama Bharatam andHastalakshana Deepika.  The attakkathasor stories are selected from the epics and myths and are written in a highly Sanskritised verse form in Malayalam. Many Malayalam writers have also contributed to the vast repertoire of Kathakali literature.           "

        "explain": "means a mountain in Hindi) is an umbrella term used for a form of Indian painting, done mostly in miniature forms, originating from Himalayan hill kingdoms of North India, during 17th-19th century, notably Basohli, Mankot, Nurpur, Chamba, Kangra, Guler, Mandi, and Garhwal. Nainsukh was a famous master of the mid-18th century, followed by his family workshop for another two generationsThe Pahari school developed and flourished during 17th-19th centuries stretching from Jammu to Almora and Garhwal, in the sub-Himalayan India, through Himachal Pradesh. Each created stark variations within the genre, ranging from bold intense Basohli Painting, originating from Basohli in Jammu and Kashmir, to the delicate and lyrical Kangra paintings, which became synonymous to the style before other schools of paintings developed. The Kangra style reached its pinnacle with paintings of Radha and Krishna, inspired by Jayadev\u0027s Gita Govinda.Pahari painting grew out of the Mughal painting, though this was patronized mostly by the Rajput kings who ruled many parts of the region, and gave birth to a new idiom in Indian painting.  Kalighat painting or Kalighat Pat originated in the 19th century Bengal, in the vicinity of Kalighat Kali Temple, Kalighat, Kolkata, India, and from being items of souvenir taken by the visitors to the Kali temple, the paintings over a period of time developed as a distinct school of Indian painting. From the depiction of Hindu gods, god, and other mythological characters, the Kalighat paintings developed to reflect a variety of themes.  Pithora is a highly ritualistic painting done on the walls by several tribes such as the Rathwas and Bhilalas who live in the central Gujarat, , in a village called Tejgadh. In several other villages around Tejgadh (even in Madhya Pradesh) and Chhota Udaipur district , lives a large population of these tribes where we find Pithora paintings on three inter walls of the house. These paintings have significance in their lives and executing the Pithora paintings in their homes brings peace, prosperity and happiness. What is even more interesting is that there is never an attempt to imitate nature. A horse or a bull, which might be a vision of a God, impresses him with only one central quality.  Pattachitra or Patachitra is a general term for traditional, cloth-based scroll painting, based in West Bengal and Odisha. Patrachitras are a component of an ancient Bengali narrative art, originally serving as a visual device during the performance of a song. Patachitra of Naya village in West Bengal is now collected in National Museum of Ethnology (henceforth MNE) in Lisbon    "

        "answer": "B",
        "explain": "Pahadi/Pahari even though grew out of Mughals, is not a Islamic painting. See previous MCQ.  Mewar painting, one of the most important schools of Rājasthanī style  Indian miniature painting of the 17th and 18th centuries. The works of the school are characterized by simple bright colour and direct emotional appeal. The earliest-dated examples come from a ragamala (musical modes) series painted in 1605 at Chawand, an early capital of the state. This expressive and vigorous style continued with some variations through 1680, after which time Mughal influence became more apparent. One of the outstanding painters of the early phase was the artist Sahibdin. The Mewar school continued through the 18th century and into the 19th, the production being fairly prolific. An increasing number of paintings were concerned with portraiture and the life of the ruler, though religious themes continued to be popular.  Bundi painting, important school of the Rajasthani style of Indian miniature painting that lasted from the 17th to the end of the 19th century in the princely state of Bundi and its neighbouring principality of Kotah (both in the present state of Rājasthān). The earliest examples (c. 1625) show Rājasthanī features, particularly in the depiction of men and women, but Mughal influence is exceptionally strong. In richness and brilliance Būndi painting has an affinity also with the painting of the Deccan, an area with which the rulers of Būndi and Kotah were often in contact. The Būndi school is characterized by a fondness for lush vegetation, dramatic night skies, a distinctive way of depicting water by light swirls against a dark background, and vivid movement. The school reached its peak during the first half of the 18th century but continued to flourish into the 19th century and had a brilliant phase at Kotah during the reign of Rām Singh II (1828–66). These vigorous paintings depict royal tiger hunts in the thick and hilly jungle of the region and various aspects of the life of the king. Ram Leela, Raas leela are also popular themes  Kishengarh and Bani Thani will be explained in a different MCQ specific to it.   "

        "explain": "Thanjavur painting is a classical South Indian painting style, which was inaugurated from the town of Thanjavur (anglicized as Tanjore) and spread across the adjoining and geographically contiguous Tamil country. The art form draws its immediate resources and inspiration from way back about 1600 AD, a period when the Nayakas of Thanjavur under the suzerainty of the Vijayanagara Rayas encouraged art—chiefly, classical dance and music—as well as literature, both in Telugu and Tamil and painting of chiefly Hindu religious subjects in temples. It is distinguished by its famous gold coating. Originated in the Maratha court of Thanjavur (1676 – 1855). It has been recognized as a Geographical indication by the Government of India in 2007-08.Thanjavur paintings are panel       paintings done on wooden planks, and hence referred to as palagai padam (palagai \u003d \"wooden plank\"; padam \u003d \"picture\") in local parlance.are characterised by rich, flat and vivid colors, simple iconic composition, glittering gold foils overlaid on delicate but extensive gesso work and inlay of glass beads and pieces or very rarely precious and semi-precious gems. In Thanjavur paintings one can see the influence of Deccani, Vijayanagar, Maratha and even European or Company styles of painting. Essentially serving as devotional icons, the subjects of most paintings are Hindu gods, goddesses, and saints. Episodes from Hindu Puranas, Sthala-puranas and other religious texts were visualised, sketched or traced and painted with the main figure or figures placed in the central section of the picture (mostly within an architecturally delineated space such as a mantapa or prabhavali) surrounded by several subsidiary figures, themes and subjects. There are also many instances when Jain, Sikh, Muslim, other religious and even secular subjects were depicted   Manjushas are an Indian art form. They are temple-shaped boxes comprising eight pillars. They are made of bamboo, jute and paper. They also contains paintings of Hindu gods and goddesses and other characters. These boxes are used in Bishahari puja, a festival dedicated to the Snake God that is celebrated in Bhagalpur and nearby regions, India. Manjusha Art is and ancient and historically significant art form, considered on a par with Madhubani art. Manjusha Art or Manjusha Kala is often referred to as Snake Paintings by foreigners as swirling snakes in the art depict the central character Bihula\u0027s tale of love and sacrifice. A recent study on Manjusha Art provides an excellent example of how this art reflects the history of ancient Anga Mahajanapada  A thangka, variously spelt as thangka, tangka, thanka, or tanka, is a Tibetan Buddhist painting on cotton, silk appliqué, usually depicting a Buddhist deity, scene, or mandala.  Thangkas are traditionally kept unframed and rolled up when not on display, mounted on a textile backing somewhat in the style of Chinese scroll paintings, with a further silk cover on the front. So treated, thangkas can last a long time, but because of their delicate nature, they have to be kept in dry places where moisture will not affect the quality of the silk. Thangka serve as important teaching tools depicting the life of the Buddha, various influential lamas and other deities and bodhisattvas. One subject is The Wheel of Life (Bhavachakra), which is a visual representation of the Abhidharma teachings (Art of Enlightenment).  The term may sometimes be used of works in other media than painting, including reliefs in metal and woodblock prints. Today printed reproductions at poster size of painted thangka are commonly used for devotional as well as decorative purposes.  Many tangkas were produced in sets, though they have often subsequently become separated.        "

It became prevalent with the fading of Basohli school of painting in mid-18th century,and soon produced such a magnitude in paintings both in content as well as volume, that the Pahari painting school, came to be known as Kangra paintings.  Though the main centres of Kangra paintings are Guler, Basohli, Chamba, Nurpur, Bilaspur and Kangra. Later on this style also reached Mandi, Suket, Kulu, Arki, Nalagarh and Tehri Garhwal (represented by Mola Ram), and now are collectively known as Pahari painting, covering the style that was patronized by Rajput rulers between the 17th and 19th centuries.  Pahari paintings, as the name suggests, were paintings executed in the hilly regions of India, in the sub-Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh. It is in the development and modification of Pahari paintings, that the Kangra School features. Under the patronage of Maharaja Sansar Chand (c.1765-      1823), it became the most important center of Pahari painting. To see some of these master pieces one can visit the Maharaja Sansar Chand Museum, adjoining the Kangra Fort in Kangra Himachal.

        "answer": "C",
        "explain": "A gharana is a system  of social organisation linking musicians or dancers by lineage or apprenticeship, and by adherence to a particular musical style. The word gharana comes from the Urdu/Hindi word ‘ghar’ which means ‘family’ or ‘house’. It typically refers to the  place where the musical ideology originated. It also indicates a comprehensive musicological ideology and differentiates from one school to another. It directly affects the thinking, teaching, performance and appreciation of music.  Benaras - Tappa singing style is an important component of this gharana. This gharana is famous for both singing and instrument playing. The singers of this gharana are also known for Khyal singing. Similarly the tabla players of Benaras gharana developed their unique style.  Jaipur - Muhammad All Khan is considered as the proponent of Khyal Gharana singing. His son Ashiq Ali Khan became the famous singer. The most distinctive feature of this gharana is its complex and melodic form which arises out of the involuted and undulating phrases that comprise the piece. Khyal singing of Jaipur gharana is famous in the contemporary times for the use of instruments. It was founded by Ustad Amir Khan  Gwalior - This is among the famous gharanas which were instrumental in popularising the Hindustani music. Bol-baant, bol-taan, no sargam, wide range in taans, alankarik taans, descending sapaat taans are roughly similar, emphasise on melody and rhythm, preference for simple (as opposed to compound) ragas, repertoire of bandishes and variety of tans. The Khyal gharana of Gwalior was founded in 19′ century. The founders of this gharana were: Haddu Khan, Hassu Khan and Natthu Khan, the three brothers, who were expert at Khyal singing.  Lucknow - This school is famous for both Thumri and Thappa style of singing. Its Thumri is related to the beauty and distinct ornamentation. The Thumri of Lucknow contains more decorative elements when compared to the Thumri of Banaras.  Kirana - This famous school of Khyal singing was founded by Ustad Abdul Karim Khan in 19th century and its name is derived from a small habitation ‘Kairana’ of Shamli district of Uttar Pradesh. This gharana is also connected to Gopal Nayak who was the court musician of Allauddin Khilji. Famous singers include: Bhannu Nayak.
